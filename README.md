# CSE323_Project

###  Abstract:
Technology breakthroughs have led to improvements in information presentation, marketing, and advertising techniques. Advertisements and notifications are displayed on dot matrix display boards. These notice boards are now a standard feature in educational institutions, retail 
establishments, and other public locations for displaying information about public transportation schedules, platform numbers, numerous product advertising, and many other relevant messages.


###  Objectives:
The main objective of our project is to display any text or number in the 4 in 1 dot matrix display. The task is really simple. Students in high school or college may easily complete this sort of project. It is a relatively inexpensive craft, and just a few materials are required to complete it. This project's hardware component is fairly simple to construct. Online instructions for this project are also available. The coding, or software, portion is a little challenging because numerous different functions and loops must be created. If any of the loops or functions fail to run, nothing is shown on the screen.


###  Rationale:
This project appeals to us since it is simple and straightforward. It has no negative effects on the environment. Students frequently utilize these dot matrix displays with Arduinos for their projects for elementary school or college. Advantages of choosing this project displays are:
- How simple it is to upload and build code using Arduino.
- The message may be updated and displayed dynamically to the audience.
- The project just needs a small number of components.
- This project is robust, and it requires essentially little upkeep.
- It is less expensive than similar ventures.
